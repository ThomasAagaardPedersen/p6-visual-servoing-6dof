# Vision-Based Robotic Arm for Weed Removal

A 6-DOF robot manipulator was designed to identify and remove weeds using a visual servoing approach combined with real-time YOLOv5 object detection.

## Features
- YOLOv5 model for weed detection
- PID control and inverse kinematics
- Real-time object targeting via camera feedback

## Technologies
- Python, OpenCV, YOLOv5
- Robotic toolbox (MATLAB)
- 6-DOF robotic arm
